### Hi!

I'm **Humberto Anjos**, either a developer, software architect or Enterprise Architect (sounds *important*, doesn't it?), depending on how the mood strikes. Although strictly speaking I'm only paid for the latter ðŸ¤« *shhh*. 

Even though my meatier stuff is employer-owned, I still keep some odds and ends around here.
