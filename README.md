### Hi!

I'm [**Humberto Anjos**][site], either a developer, software architect or enterprise architect, depending on how the mood strikes. Although, strictly speaking, I'm only paid for the latter ðŸ¤« *shhh*

Even though my meatier stuff is employer-owned, there's still some odds, ends and ramblings here. Let me know if anything's useful!
