### Hi!

I'm **Humberto Anjos**, either a developer, software architect or Enterprise Architect (sounds *important*, doesn't it?), depending on how the mood strikes. Although, strictly speaking, I'm only paid for the latter ðŸ¤« *shhh*

Even though my meatier stuff is employer-owned, there's still some odds and ends here. Feel free to let me know if anything's useful (which may be met with some surprise ðŸ˜œ)!
